# HR Tech Portfolio  

This repository showcases my journey into **HR Tech & People Analytics**.  
It contains hands-on projects where I apply **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and People Analytics concepts** to real-world HR data.

## 📊 Project 1: Attrition Risk Analyzer (v1.0)

**Objective:**  
Analyze IBM’s HR Attrition dataset to identify patterns of employee attrition, create a risk flag, and visualize insights.  

**Key Steps:**  
1. Load and explore the dataset (1470 employees, 35 features).  
2. Analyze attrition distribution overall and by job role.  
3. Create a binary attrition risk flag (Yes = 1, No = 0).  
4. Build visualizations:
   - Overall attrition counts  
   - Attrition by department  
   - Attrition by age distribution  
   - Attrition % by job role

## 🔍 Key Insights  

- Overall attrition rate: **16.1%**  
- Job roles with highest attrition:  
  - Sales Representatives → 39% attrition (83 out of 220 left)  
  - Laboratory Technicians → 23% attrition (62 out of 259 left)  
- Lowest attrition: **R&D (13.8%)** → strongest retention  
- Highest attrition: **Sales (20.6%)** → weakest retention  
- HR is small (63 employees), but attrition rate is relatively high (19%)  
- Age groups younger than ~30 show elevated risk compared to older cohorts
