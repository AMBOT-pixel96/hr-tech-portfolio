## 📊 Project 1: Attrition Risk Analyzer (v1.0)

### v1.0 — Descriptive Insights
**Objective:**  
Analyze IBM’s HR Attrition dataset to identify patterns of employee attrition, create a risk flag, and visualize insights.

---

**Why This Matters (Business Context):**  
Employee attrition directly impacts business costs through lost productivity, rehiring, and retraining.  
By identifying high-risk roles and departments, organizations can proactively design retention strategies,  
reduce turnover costs, and improve workforce stability.

---

**Key Steps:**  
1. Load and explore the dataset (1470 employees, 35 features).  
2. Analyze attrition distribution overall and by job role.  
3. Create a binary attrition risk flag (Yes = 1, No = 0).  
4. Build visualizations:
   - Overall attrition counts  
   - Attrition by department  
   - Attrition by age distribution  
   - Attrition % by job role  

📓 [View the Jupyter Notebook](notebooks/Day4-AttritionRiskAnalyzer.ipynb)  

---

### v2.0 — Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression)  

**Objective:**  
Move from descriptive analytics → predictive insights by using **Logistic Regression** to forecast employee attrition risk. 

**Key Steps:**  
1. Data preprocessing  
   - Dropped irrelevant features (EmployeeNumber, Over18, etc.)  
   - Encoded categorical variables via one-hot encoding  
   - Scaled numeric features  
   - Train-test split (70/30)  
2. Model training with Logistic Regression (`scikit-learn`)  
3. Model evaluation  
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Classification report (precision, recall, F1)  
   - ROC-AUC score  
4. Feature importance analysis → which factors most influence attrition risk  
5. Saved trained model + scaler into `/models/`  
6. Fixed Data Leakage issue and added enhancements

## 📊 Project 6: Model Explainability with SHAP

**Objective:**  
Use SHAP values to interpret XGBoost predictions, showing both global and local drivers of attrition.  

---

### 🔑 Key Steps  
1. **Load & preprocess data** → Dropped leakage columns, encoded categoricals, ensured numeric types.  
2. **Load trained XGBoost model** → From Project 5 (`xgboost_attrition_model.pkl`).  
3. **Subsample data (100 rows)** → Keeps SHAP efficient & avoids kernel crashes.  
4. **Compute SHAP values** → Using new `shap.Explainer` API.  
5. **Generate visuals**:  
   - Global feature importance & summary plots.  
   - Local explanations (waterfall + bar).  
   - Dependence plot for feature interactions.  
6. **Export artifacts** → Saved plots in `/images/` for portfolio clarity.  

---

### 📈 Results

  - Age, Distance from Home, and Daily Rate (Compensation )are the most influential features.  
- **Local Explanations:**  
  - For an individual employee, SHAP shows exactly which features push their attrition risk up or down.  
- **Feature Interactions:**  
  - Dependence plots reveal how attrition risk rises at lower income bands and with frequent overtime.  
- **Takeaway:**  
  - Moves the model from “black box” → **explainable AI**, building trust with HR leaders.

- [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) → dependencies for deployment  

---

### ✅ Conclusions  
- Streamlit deployment shows the ability to go beyond notebooks and create **real-world HR tools**.  
- Adds credibility for consulting/analytics roles by showcasing full-stack delivery.  
- Sets foundation for future dashboards (Compensation, SQL+ML, etc.).  

---

### 🚀 Next Steps  
- Build **SQL + ML pipeline** to query databases + run predictions (Project 8).  
- Extend dashboard with **Compensation Analytics** modules.
## 📊 Project 8: SQL + ML Integration  

**Objective:**  
Bridge **SQL querying power** with **Machine Learning predictions** for HR attrition risk.  
This project shows how HR teams can query their employee database (like an HRIS system) and instantly run ML predictions on the results.  

**Why It Matters (Business Context):**  
- HR data lives in **databases** (HRIS, payroll, ERP).  
- Analysts need the ability to query + predict attrition directly.  
- This integration makes predictive analytics **practical in enterprise settings**.  

---

### 🔑 Key Steps  
1. **Database Creation** → Converted IBM dataset → SQLite DB (`hr_dataset.db`) with `employees` table.  
2. **Helper Scripts** →  
   - [`helper_scripts/hr_db.py`](helper_scripts/hr_db.py) → builds DB from CSV.  
   - [`helper_scripts/sql_utils.py`](helper_scripts/sql_utils.py) → safe query execution + sample queries.  
3. **SQL Queries** → Run HR-style queries (e.g., attrition by department, tenure distribution).  
4. **ML Integration** → Query results → feature alignment → scaled → predictions using trained XGBoost model.  
5. **Visuals** → Donut chart (Safe vs At Risk), Department stacked bars, Probability distribution.  
6. **Optimized Predictions** →  
   - Leakage fix (drops `Attrition` col).  
   - Proper scaling.  
   - Tuned threshold (`0.65`) for realistic at-risk counts.

- **Database** → [hr_dataset.db](data/hr_dataset.db)  
- **Dataset** → [employee_attrition.csv](data/employee_attrition.csv)  
- **Helper Scripts** → [`helper_scripts/`](helper_scripts/)  
- **Predictions Export** → [Attrition_SQL_Predictions.csv](data/Attrition_SQL_Predictions.csv)  

---

### ✅ Conclusion  

- SQL + ML pipeline works end-to-end.  
- Analysts can run **attrition queries directly on DB** and immediately see predictions.  
- Departments with high predicted risk can be flagged for **retention interventions**.  

**Way Forward:**  
- Expand SQL query library (e.g., gender pay parity, tenure buckets).  
- Connect to **real HRIS / cloud DB** instead of static CSV.  
- Build a Streamlit **C&B Dashboard** (next side quest).

## 📊 Project 10: Attrition Explainability with SHAP (v1.0)

**Objective:**  
Enhance interpretability of advanced attrition models (Random Forest / XGBoost) using **SHAP** values.  
This project makes the “black box” models explainable, showing **which features drive attrition** at both global (all employees) and local (individual employee) levels.  

**Why This Matters (Business Context):**  
- Executives need to know not just *who* is at risk, but *why*.  
- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) builds trust by linking predictions to actionable factors.  
- Transparency ensures fairness in HR decisions and strengthens adoption of predictive analytics.  

### 🔑 Key Steps
1. Loaded trained model + aligned dataset (clean features, leakage removed).  
2. Generated **SHAP Summary Plot** → top global drivers of attrition.  
3. Built **Top 15 Feature Importance (Bar Plot)** for easy business readability.  
4. Exported **full feature importance table (44 features)** to CSV for reference.  
5. Created **Dependence Plot** (MonthlyIncome vs Attrition risk).  
6. Generated **Local Waterfall Plot** → explains why one employee was flagged “At Risk.”  
7. Saved all charts + artifacts for portfolio showcase.  

### 📈 Results
- **Global Drivers:** Age, DailyRate, MonthlyIncome, OverTime consistently top predictors.  
- **Top 15 Features:** Captured ~80% of SHAP importance (clear drivers visible in business plots).  
- **Local Explanation:** Waterfall plots show *exactly which factors push an individual into attrition risk*.  
- **Artifacts Exported:** All visuals and CSV available for download.  

### 🖼️ Visuals

### 📦 Artifacts

- **Images:**  
  - SHAP Summary Plot (Global)  
  - Top 15 Feature Importance (Bar)  
  - SHAP Dependence Plot — MonthlyIncome  
  - Local SHAP Waterfall (Employee 0)

### ✅ Conclusion
- Project 10 brings **explainable AI** to the HR Attrition domain.  
- Moves beyond prediction → **interpretation**.  
- Business users now get *clear charts* + *tables* linking model predictions to real HR actions.
