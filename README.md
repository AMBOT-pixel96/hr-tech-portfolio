## 📊 Project 1: Attrition Risk Analyzer (v1.0)

**Objective:**  
Analyze IBM’s HR Attrition dataset to identify patterns of employee attrition, create a risk flag, and visualize insights.  

**Key Steps:**  
1. Load and explore the dataset (1470 employees, 35 features).  
2. Analyze attrition distribution overall and by job role.  
3. Create a binary attrition risk flag (Yes = 1, No = 0).  
4. Build visualizations:
   - Overall attrition counts  
   - Attrition by department  
   - Attrition by age distribution  
   - Attrition % by job role  

**Tech Stack:**  
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)  
- Dataset: [IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)  

**Sample Output:**
