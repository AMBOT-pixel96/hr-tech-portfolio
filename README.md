This repository showcases my journey into **HR Tech & People Analytics**.

This repository showcases my journey into **HR Tech & People Analytics**.  
It contains hands-on projects where I apply **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and People Analytics concepts** to real-world HR data.

## üìä Project 1: Attrition Risk Analyzer (v1.0)

### v1.0 ‚Äî Descriptive Insights
**Objective:**  
Analyze IBM‚Äôs HR Attrition dataset to identify patterns of employee attrition, create a risk flag, and visualize insights.

---

**Why This Matters (Business Context):**  
Employee attrition directly impacts business costs through lost productivity, rehiring, and retraining.  
By identifying high-risk roles and departments, organizations can proactively design retention strategies,  
reduce turnover costs, and improve workforce stability.

---

**Key Steps:**  
1. Load and explore the dataset (1470 employees, 35 features).  
2. Analyze attrition distribution overall and by job role.  
3. Create a binary attrition risk flag (Yes = 1, No = 0).  
4. Build visualizations:
   - Overall attrition counts  
   - Attrition by department  
   - Attrition by age distribution  
   - Attrition % by job role

### v2.0 ‚Äî Predictive Modeling (Logistic Regression)  

**Objective:**  
Move from descriptive analytics ‚Üí predictive insights by using **Logistic Regression** to forecast employee attrition risk. 

**Key Steps:**  
1. Data preprocessing  
   - Dropped irrelevant features (EmployeeNumber, Over18, etc.)  
   - Encoded categorical variables via one-hot encoding  
   - Scaled numeric features  
   - Train-test split (70/30)  
2. Model training with Logistic Regression (`scikit-learn`)  
3. Model evaluation  
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Classification report (precision, recall, F1)  
   - ROC-AUC score  
4. Feature importance analysis ‚Üí which factors most influence attrition risk  
5. Saved trained model + scaler into `/models/`

## üîç Key Insights  

- Overall attrition rate: **16.1%**  
- Job roles with highest attrition:  
  - Sales Representatives ‚Üí 39% attrition (83 out of 220 left)  
  - Laboratory Technicians ‚Üí 23% attrition (62 out of 259 left)  
- Lowest attrition: **R&D (13.8%)** ‚Üí strongest retention  
- Highest attrition: **Sales (20.6%)** ‚Üí weakest retention  
- HR is small (63 employees), but attrition rate is relatively high (19%)  
- Age groups younger than ~30 show elevated risk compared to older cohorts  

**From Predictive Model:**  
- Logistic Regression achieved ~`XX%` accuracy, ROC-AUC = `X.XX`.  
- Key positive attrition drivers: *Overtime, JobRole_SalesRep, MaritalStatus_Single, etc.*  
- Key retention drivers: *JobLevel, YearsAtCompany, MonthlyIncome*.
